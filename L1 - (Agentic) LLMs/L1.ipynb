        "\n",
        "Key characteristics of AutoGen agents:\n",
        "- **Autonomy**: Agents can operate independently and make decisions based on their programming and context\n",
        "- **Specialization**: Each agent can be designed for specific tasks (e.g., coding, analysis, review)\n",
        "- **Communication**: Agents can exchange messages and collaborate to solve problems\n",

        "- **Message Routing**: Handles communication between agents\n",

        "- **State Management**: Maintains the state of conversations and agent interactions\n",

        "The Group Chat pattern is a fundamental multi-agent design pattern in AutoGen that enables task decomposition and collaborative problem-solving:\n",
        "\n",
        "**How it works:**\n",
        "1. **Task Decomposition**: Complex problems are broken down into smaller, manageable subtasks\n",
        "2. **Agent Specialization**: Different agents are assigned specific roles (e.g., planner, coder, reviewer, executor)\n",
        "3. **Collaborative Execution**: Agents work together in a structured conversation to solve the overall problem\n",
        "4. **Dynamic Interaction**: Agents can request help, provide feedback, and iterate on solutions\n",
        "\n",
        "**Benefits:**\n",
        "- **Scalability**: Complex tasks can be distributed across multiple specialized agents\n",
