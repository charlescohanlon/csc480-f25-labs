    "# CSC 480-F25 Lab 7: Reasoning and Querying Knowledge Graphs\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab you will load the case data from Lab 6 into Neo4j and practice reasoning via Cypher queries. Youâ€™ll start by verifying a Neo4j connection, read all CSVs into pandas DataFrames, insert nodes and relationships into the graph (manual path), and then optionally use an agentic system to suggest and run useful investigative queries. The goal is to translate investigative questions into concrete queries and interpret the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end, you should be able to:\n",
    "- Import entities and relationships from CSVs into a Neo4j graph.\n",
    "- Formulate and execute Cypher queries to answer investigative questions.\n",
    "- (Optional) Use an agentic system to propose/select useful queries and run them via a tool.\n"
